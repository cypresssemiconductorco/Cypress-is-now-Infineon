# Cypress-is-now-Infineon
Cypress repositories are now available in the Infineon Technologies organization.

With the acquisition of Cypress by Infineon, our customers have access to a combined comprehensive portfolio for linking the real world with the digital world.
Our portfolio offers an unparalleled range of hardware, software and security solutions for the connected age.

Along with our combined portfolio, we are moving toward providing one interface for all our collateral and tools to our customers and partners.
As part of this effort, we have combined the Cypress GitHub organization (cypresssemiconductorco) with the Infineon GitHub organization (Infineon). All Cypress repositories are now available in the [Infineon Technologies GitHub Organization](https://github.com/Infineon).
